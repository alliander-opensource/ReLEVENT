# Scope

This project will create limiting schedules at Alliander's HEDERA and forward these to FLEDGE instance

To make the code more useable, several subprojects exist:
 - slightly modified HEDERA client code, autogenerated by swagger.io
 - a 61850 client
 - a application that brings the above two together
 - docker-plain-image a Dockerfile that contains all depedencies for this application
 - docker-image a Dockerfile + configuration added by the user that is ready to be run. Configuration needs to be added by the user.
 
# Building and running
Simply run `docker-compose up`. Make sure that the n61850-smqtt-ubuntu2004 containing the 61850 north scheduler, fledge, feldge-gui and the test mqtt broker docker is also running.

In order to run, a file `hedera-interface.ini` that contains credentials and MRIDs is expected [here](hedera-interface.ini). It is mounted into the docker as a volume. Modify it to your needs.

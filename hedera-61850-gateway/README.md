# Scope

This project will create limiting schedules at Alliander's HEDERA and forward these to FLEDGE instance

To make the code more useable, several subprojects exist:
 - slightly modified HEDERA client code, autogenerated by swagger.io
 - a 61850 client
 - a application that brings the above two together
 
# Building and running
Simply run `build-and-run.sh`, this should work on Linux computers.
